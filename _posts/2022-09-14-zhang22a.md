title: On the Nash equilibrium of moment-matching GANs for stationary Gaussian processes
abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) learn an implicit generative model
  from data samples through a two-player game. In this paper, we study the existence
  of Nash equilibrium of the game which is consistent as the number of data samples
  grows to infinity. In a realizable setting where the goal is to estimate the ground-truth
  generator of a stationary Gaussian process, we show that the existence of consistent
  Nash equilibrium depends crucially on the choice of the discriminator family. The
  discriminator defined from second-order statistical moments can result in non-existence
  of Nash equilibrium, existence of consistent non-Nash equilibrium, or existence
  and uniqueness of consistent Nash equilibrium, depending on whether symmetry properties
  of the generator family are respected. We further study empirically the local stability
  and global convergence of gradient descent-ascent methods towards consistent equilibrium.
