title: Error Estimates for the Deep Ritz Method with Boundary Penalty
abstract: We estimate the error of the Deep Ritz Method for linear elliptic equations.
  For Dirichlet boundary conditions, we estimate the error when the boundary values
  are imposed through the boundary penalty method. Our results apply to arbitrary
  sets of ansatz functions and estimate the error in dependence of the optimization
  accuracy, the approximation capabilities of the ansatz class and – in the case of
  Dirichlet boundary values – the penalization strength $\lambda$. To the best of
  our knowledge, our results are presently the only ones in the literature that treat
  the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions in full generality, i.e., without a lower
  order term that leads to coercivity on all of $H^1(\Omega)$. Further, we discuss
  the implications of our results for ansatz classes which are given through ReLU
  networks and the relation to existing estimates for finite element functions. For
  high dimensional problems our results show that the favourable approximation capabilities
  of neural networks for smooth functions are inherited by the Deep Ritz Method.
