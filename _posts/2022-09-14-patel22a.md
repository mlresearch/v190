title: Error-in-variables modelling for operator learning
abstract: Deep operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for reduced-order
  modelling and PDE model discovery. Leveraging the expressive power of deep neural
  networks, especially in high dimensions, such methods learn the mapping between
  functional state variables. While proposed methods have assumed noise only in the
  dependent variables, experimental and numerical data for operator learning typically
  exhibit noise in the independent variables as well, since both variables represent
  signals that are subject to measurement error. In regression on scalar data, failure
  to account for noisy independent variables can lead to biased parameter estimates.
  With noisy independent variables, linear models fitted via ordinary least squares
  (OLS) will show attenuation bias, wherein the slope will be underestimated. In this
  work, we derive an analogue of attenuation bias for linear operator regression with
  white noise in both the independent and dependent variables, showing that the norm
  upper bound of the operator learned via OLS decreases with increasing noise in the
  independent variable. In the nonlinear setting, we computationally demonstrate underprediction
  of the action of the Burgers operator in the presence of noise in the independent
  variable. We propose error-in-variables (EiV) models for two operator regression
  methods, MOR-Physics and DeepONet, and demonstrate that these new models reduce
  bias in the presence of noisy independent variables for a variety of operator learning
  problems. Considering the Burgers operator in 1D and 2D, we demonstrate that EiV
  operator learning robustly recovers operators in high-noise regimes that defeat
  OLS operator learning. We also introduce an EiV model for time-evolving PDE discovery
  and show that OLS and EiV perform similarly in learning the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
  evolution operator from corrupted data, suggesting that the effect of bias in OLS
  operator learning depends on the regularity of the target operator.
