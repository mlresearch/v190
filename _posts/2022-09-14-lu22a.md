title: Data adaptive RKHS Tikhonov regularization for learning kernels in operators
abstract: 'We present DARTR: a Data Adaptive RKHS Tikhonov Regularization method for
  the linear inverse problem of nonparametric learning of function parameters in operators.
  A key ingredient is a system intrinsic data adaptive (SIDA) RKHS, whose norm restricts
  the learning to take place in the function space of identifiability. DARTR utilizes
  this norm and selects the regularization parameter by the L-curve method. We illustrate
  its performance in examples including integral operators, nonlinear operators and
  nonlocal operators with discrete synthetic data. Numerical results show that DARTR
  leads to an accurate estimator robust to both numerical error due to discrete data
  and noise in data, and the estimator converges at a consistent rate as the data
  mesh refines under different levels of noises, outperforming two baseline regularizers
  using $l^2$ and $L^2$ norms.'
