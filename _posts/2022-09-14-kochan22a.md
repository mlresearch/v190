title: A Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method for Missing Data Imputation
abstract: We propose a hybrid technique combining Bayesian inference and quantum-inspired
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QHMC) method for imputation of missing datasets. QHMC is
  an efficient way to sample from a broad class of distributions. Unlike the standard
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in which a particle has a fixed mass, QHMC allows
  a particle to have a random mass matrix with a probability distribution. Our data
  imputation method uses stochastic gradient optimization in QHMC to avoid calculating
  the full gradient on the entire dataset when evolving the Hamiltonian system. We
  combine the stochastic gradient QHMC and first order Langevin dynamics to obtain
  samples whose distribution converges to the posterior one. Comparing the performance
  of our method with existing imputation methods on several datasets, we found out
  that our proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of data imputation.
