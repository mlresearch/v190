title: An Upper Limit of Decaying Rate with Respect to Frequency in Linear Frequency
  Principle Model
abstract: 'Deep neural network (DNN) usually learns the target function from low to
  high frequency, which is called frequency principle or spectral bias. This frequency
  principle sheds light on a high-frequency curse of DNNs â€” difficult to learn high-frequency
  information. Inspired by the frequency principle, a series of works are devoted
  to develop algorithms for overcoming the high-frequency curse. A natural question
  arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate w.r.t. frequency when one trains
  a DNN? In this work, we abstract a paradigm for modeling and analysis of algorithm
  suitable for supervised learning problems from the sufficiently wide two-layer neural
  network, i.e., linear frequency principle (LFP) model. Our theory confirms that
  there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t. frequency in LFP model. It is precisely
  because of the existence of this limit that a sufficiently wide DNN interpolates
  the training data by a function with a certain regularity. However, if the decay
  rate of an algrithm in our paradigm is above such upper limit, then this algorithm
  interpolates the training data by a trivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero
  at training data points. This work rigorously proves that the high-frequency curse
  is an intrinsic difficulty of the LFP model, which provides similar insight to DNN.'
