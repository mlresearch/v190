title: 'MURANA: A Generic Framework for Stochastic Variance-Reduced Optimization'
abstract: We propose a generic variance-reduced algorithm, which we call MUltiple
  RANdomized Algorithm (MURANA), for minimizing a sum of several smooth functions
  plus a regularizer, in a sequential or distributed manner. Our method is formulated
  with general stochastic operators, which allow us to model various strategies for
  reducing the computational complexity. For example, MURANA supports sparse activation
  of the gradients, and also reduction of the communication load via compression of
  the update vectors. This versatility allows MURANA to cover many existing randomization
  mechanisms within a unified framework, which also makes it possible to design new
  methods as special cases.
