title: Learning Green’s Functions of Linear Reaction-Diffusion Equations with Application
  to Fast Numerical Solver
abstract: Partial differential equations are often used to model various physical
  phenomena, such as heat diffusion, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, elasticity,
  electrodynamics and so on. Due to their important applications in scientific research
  and engineering, many numerical methods have been developed in the past decades
  for efficient and accurate solutions of these equations. Inspired by the rapidly
  growing impact of deep learning techniques, we propose in this paper a novel neural
  network method, “GF-Net”, for learning the Green’s functions of the classic linear
  reaction-diffusion equations in the unsupervised fashion. The proposed method overcomes
  the challenges for finding the Green’s functions of the equations on arbitrary domains
  by utilizing the physics-informed neural network approach and domain decomposition.
  As a consequence, it particularly leads to a fast algorithm for solving the target
  equations subject to various sources and Dirichlet boundary conditions without network
  retraining. We also numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
  by extensive experiments in the square, annular and L-shape domains.
