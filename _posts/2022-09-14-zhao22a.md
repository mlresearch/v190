title: Adaptive sampling methods for learning dynamical systems
abstract: Learning dynamical systems from observed trajectories is a fundamental problem
  in data-driven science and engineering. While many existing works focus on improving
  model architectures or training methods, less attention has been directed at how
  to effectively sample training data to give rise to accurate models. In particular,
  one of the most basic problems is to select the length of sampled trajectories that
  balances computational overhead due to sampling and the quality of learned models.
  This paper deals with the task of improving sampling efficiency for learning dynamics.We
  first formulate proper target risks to evaluate the model performance of learning
  in the dynamical setting.This allows us to connect generalization to matching empirical
  measures with specific target measures. In line with this observation, we propose
  a class of adaptive algorithms to find effective sampling strategies that control
  the length of sampled trajectories. Through numerical experiments, we show the adaptive
  algorithms can achieve more accurate results given a sampling budget compared to
  baseline sampling methods.
