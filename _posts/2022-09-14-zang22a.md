title: A Machine Learning Enhanced Algorithm for the Optimal Landing Problem
abstract: We propose a machine learning enhanced algorithm for solving the optimal
  landing problem. Using Pontryaginâ€™s minimum principle, we derive a two-point boundary
  value problem for the landing problem. The proposed algorithm uses deep learning
  to predict the optimal landing time and a space-marching technique to provide good
  initial guesses for the boundary value problem solver. The performance of the proposed
  method is studied using the quadrotor example, a reasonably high dimensional and
  strongly nonlinear system. Drastic improvement in reliability and efficiency is
  observed.
