title: Concentration of Random Feature Matrices in High-Dimensions
abstract: The spectra of random feature matrices provide essential information on
  the conditioning of the linear system used in random feature regression problems
  and are thus connected to the consistency and generalization of random feature models.
  Random feature matrices are asymmetric rectangular nonlinear matrices depending
  on two input variables, the data and the weights, which can make their characterization
  challenging. We consider two settings for the two input variables, either both are
  random variables or one is a random variable and the other is well-separated, i.e.
  there is a minimum distance between points. With conditions on the dimension, the
  complexity ratio, and the sampling variance, we show that the singular values of
  these matrices concentrate near their full expectation and near one with high-probability.
  In particular, since the dimension depends only on the logarithm of the number of
  random weights or the number of data points, our complexity bounds can be achieved
  even in moderate dimensions for many practical setting. The theoretical results
  are verified with numerical experiments.
