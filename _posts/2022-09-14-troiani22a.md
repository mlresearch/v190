title: Optimal denoising of rotationally invariant rectangular matrices
abstract: 'In this manuscript we consider denoising of large rectangular matrices:
  given a noisy observation of a signal matrix, what is the best way of recovering
  the signal matrix itself? For Gaussian noise and rotationally-invariant signal priors,
  we completely characterize the optimal denoiser and its performance in the high-dimensional
  limit, in which the size of the signal matrix goes to infinity with fixed aspects
  ratio, and under the Bayes optimal setting, that is when the statistician knows
  how the signal and the observations were generated. Our results generalise previous
  works that considered only symmetric matrices to the more general case of non-symmetric
  and rectangular ones. We explore analytically and numerically a particular choice
  of factorized signal prior that models cross-covariance matrices and the matrix
  factorization problem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide an explicit asymptotic
  evaluation of the rectangular Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral in a special
  case.'
