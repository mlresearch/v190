title: 'SHRIMP: Sparser Random Feature Models via Iterative Magnitude Pruning'
abstract: Sparse shrunk additive models and sparse random feature models have been
  developed separately as methods to learn low-order functions, where there are few
  interactions between variables, but neither offers computational efficiency. On
  the other hand, $\ell_2$-based shrunk additive models are efficient but do not offer
  feature selection as the resulting coefficient vectors are dense. Inspired by the
  success of the iterative magnitude pruning technique in finding lottery tickets
  of neural networks, we propose a new method—Sparser Random Feature Models via IMP
  (ShRIMP)—to efficiently fit high-dimensional data with inherent low-dimensional
  structure in the form of sparse variable dependencies. Our method can be viewed
  as a combined process to construct and find sparse lottery tickets for two-layer
  dense networks. We explain the observed benefit of SHRIMP through a refined analysis
  of the generalization error for thresholded Basis Pursuit and resulting bounds on
  eigenvalues. From function approximation experiments on both synthetic data and
  real-world benchmark datasets, we show that SHRIMP obtains better than or competitive
  test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art sparse feature and additive methods such
  as SRFE-S, SSAM, and SALSA. Meanwhile, SHRIMP performs feature selection with low
  computational complexity and is robust to the pruning rate, indicating robustness
  in the structure of the obtained subnetworks. We gain insight into the lottery ticket
  hypothesis through SHRIMP by noting a correspondence between our model and weight/neuron
  subnetworks.
