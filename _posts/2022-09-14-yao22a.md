title: Monte Carlo Tree Search based Hybrid Optimization of Variational Quantum Circuits
abstract: Variational quantum algorithms stand at the forefront of simulations on
  near-term and future fault-tolerant quantum devices. While most variational quantum
  algorithms involve only continuous optimization variables, the representation power
  of the variational ansatz can sometimes be significantly enhanced by adding certain
  discrete optimization variables, as is exemplified by the generalized quantum approximate
  optimization algorithm (QAOA). However, the hybrid discrete-continuous optimization
  problem in the generalized QAOA poses a challenge to the optimization. We propose
  a new algorithm called MCTS-QAOA, which combines a Monte Carlo tree search method
  with an improved policy gradient solver to optimize the discrete and continuous
  variables in the quantum circuit, respectively. We find that MCTS-QAOA has excellent
  noise-resilience properties, and can outperform prior algorithms in challenging
  instances of the generalized QAOA.
