title: Structure-preserving Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics for Data-driven
  Modeling
abstract: Discovery of dynamical systems from data forms the foundation for data-driven
  modeling and recently, structure-preserving geometric perspectives have been shown
  to provide improved forecasting, stability, and physical realizability guarantees.
  We present here a unification of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
  (SINDy) formalism with neural ordinary differential equations. The resulting framework
  allows learning of both “black-box” dynamics and learning of structure preserving
  bracket formalisms for both reversible and irreversible dynamics. We present a suite
  of benchmarks demonstrating effectiveness and structure preservation, including
  for chaotic systems.
